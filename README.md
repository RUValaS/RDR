# RDR
Reconstruction dynamique radiosatro, stage M1


Ignore "rendu" and "article", those are for redaction only and do not do anything in the code.

main and main_2 are deprecated, main_loop is the last version (allows running multiple simulations and exporting results)

check 'mode' setting in main_loop before running, if you do not have GPU and at least 4GB video memory mode='GPU' will not work, only mode='CPU' might work
